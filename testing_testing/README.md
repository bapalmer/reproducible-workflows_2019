# reproducible-workflows_2019

## Testing, testing, 1, 2 , 3, testing

**In RStudio, open the reproducible-workflows_2019 R-project file and then run test_script.R**

If your 'Console' and 'Plot' windows mirror that of the successful_test.png file, GREAT!

Otherwise you might want to ensure you (a) opened the R-project `reproducible-workflows_2019` and run the file from there, 
(b) are using the latest version of R or (c) are using the latest version of the tidyverse.

For more on updating your version of R, follow the steps provided in the R_update_presentation.pdf. Better to do this via the R GUI,
rather than in the RStudio GUI.
