# reproducible-workflows_2019

## Testing, testing, 1, 2 , 3, testing

**In RStudio, open and run test_script.R**

 If your Console and Plot windows mirror that of the successful_test.png file, GREAT!

Otherwise you might want to ensure you (a) opened the R-project `reproducible-workflows_2019` and run the file there, (b) are using the latest version of R or
 (c) are using the latest version of the tidyverse.

For more on updating your version of R, follow the steps provided in the R_update_presentation.pdf. Better to do this via the R GUI, rather than in the RStudio GUI.
